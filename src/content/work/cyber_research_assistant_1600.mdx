Investigated the trade-off between shallow and deep learning techniques in preventing cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure by comparing the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of various machine learning models and the time taken to process network traffic. During this process I was under the supervision of Dr Abigail Koay.

- Developed a internet traffic pre-processor in Python to turn raw packets in a readable format for SciKitLearn's machine learning models.
- Invesitagated the abilities of KNN, k-Means, Random Forest, and SVM algorithms and deduce their viability in network intrusion detection. Each were trained and tested with variations of Shannon Entropy pre-processing on the given attack dataset.
