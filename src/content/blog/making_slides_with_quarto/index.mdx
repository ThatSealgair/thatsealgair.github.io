# Introduction
In the second half of the year I will be running a workshop on embedded Rust developement. As part of this workshop, displaying the theory and code examples in slides would be the best way to communicate the core concepts the students need to understand. Given my history of "*making things harder on myself then they need to be*", I have decided to move away from PowerPoint and utilise a more progromatic approach. This lead me to Quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.

# Why Quarto?
I had originally read an article on Medium about developing slide show presentations with Python. Unfortunately, I could not find that article again. This initial article conveyed to me how simple it was to display code snippets with animations and display algorithms in real time. 

I began searching for progromatic ways of creating slides with Python. Many blog posts and tutorials appeared to me were more complex methods of creating regular Power Point presentations. Finally, I came to a Reddit post disucssing what I was looking for and Quarto was highlighted by multiple comments as being an example of what I wanted. Despite needing to use a different development enviroment then I normally utilise, VScode and Jupyter Notebook, it appeared to be a great way of achieving my goal.
