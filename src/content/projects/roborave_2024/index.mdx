# Introduction
RoboRAVE is an annual international robotics competition with multiple categories. This year, myself alongside two friends competed in the *Open SumoBot* competition. The goal of a sumo bot competiton is to develop an autonomous droid to knock the opponent's robot out of the ring or flip it over so it cannot compete. The rules for the competition can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10yRANbdsNWBh0gvCb72gsY9oL0nG66Z5/view?usp=sharing).

My role in the team was to select the correct sensors and develop the firmware and AI to control the droid. We started with the ESPRESSIF [ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1](https://www.espressif.com/en/dev-board/esp32-c3-devkit-rust-1-en), as it was given to us free by [UQ MARS](https://uqmars.com/), the student society we are affiliated with.
