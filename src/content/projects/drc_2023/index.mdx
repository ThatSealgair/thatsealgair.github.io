# Introduction
The Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Robotics Club hosts the *Droid Racing Challenge* (DRC) each year. It is a friendly national competition where competitors design and develop droids to race through a track, staying within the lines, and avoiding obsticals. This year, my team "UQ 1" won the Organisers Choice Award; the organiser's preferred droid.
